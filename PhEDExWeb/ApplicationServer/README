Development notes:
==================

Proxy server:

phedex_proxy.py is a workaround for the single-source restriction in 
javascript. Edit it to point to the dataservice you wish to use, then you 
can browse to the host:port that it is running on and access the service. 

Files accessed as host:port/readfile/<path> via the proxy will be served 
directly, e.g. http://localhost:30001/readfile/phedex3.html, whereas 
dataservice calls (host:port/phedex/<path>) will be passed through to the 
dataservice.
