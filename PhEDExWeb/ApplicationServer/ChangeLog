 * Changes in BETA_0_2

   * Improvements to the navigator global filter, including filter
     field help text and collapsable sections in filter form.

 * Version BETA_0_1

 First release including:

   * Navigator: an application navigation component.  This component
     sits at the top of the page and allows the user to selcect the
     "target type" (context, e.g. node), the "target value"
     (e.g. T0_CH_CERN_Export) and the widget (e.g. Links).  A global
     filter maintains filter state between widgets and provides a
     syntax for filter options to be applied to widgets.
   * Nodes widget: shows a list of nodes and associated properties in
     a sortable table.
   * Agents widget: shows a list of agents and associated properties
     in a sortable table
   * LinkView widget: shows the incoming/outgoing transfers for a
     given node, including the recent transfer statistics (rate,
     errors, quality) and the number of files currently in queue.  The
     user may drill-down into a link to see the currently queued
     blocks and files.
   * Context-Menu based navigation and operation.  Users can right-
     click on elements to navigate to another view of that element
     (e.g., see the agents running from some node clicked on) or issue
     commands to the widget (e.g. sort by that data field)

 This release is for early evaluation of the application and is
 intended to demonstrate the framework for which further widgets will
 be built upon.  The widgets provided are intended to be functional
 for their purpose, but by no means are all requirements of this
 application met in this release.
