 * Changes in BETA_0_3

   * This is the (first) Spring 2010 beta release. See https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PhedexProjWebsite#Plan_for_the_Spring_2010_Beta for more information
   * Re-write using new architecture.
   * Several new modules added. The set for this release is:
      phedex-module-agentlogs.js
      phedex-module-agents.js
      phedex-module-blocklocation.js
      phedex-module-groupusage.js
      phedex-module-linkview.js
      phedex-module-missingfiles.js
      phedex-module-nodes.js
      phedex-module-queuedmigrations.js
      phedex-module-static.js
   * Known features. I.e. inconsistencies, incompleteness, or other things we do not consider to be bugs
      * Some context-menu possibilities are missing. E.g, in the 'missingfiles' module, node-names appear, but there is no context-menu option to navigate to their agents or links views etc
      * The 'blocklocation' module is not like the rest. It does not have a context menu or a filter, for example
      * The 'global filter' input box does not do anything if you edit it. At the moment, it simply reflects the status of the current module-filter, so is not truly a global filter at all
      * The filter-state does not appear in the permalinks or the browser history. Although it can be set from a permalink, you would have to construct that permalink by hand, yourself.

 * Changes in BETA_0_2

   * Improvements to the navigator global filter, including filter
     field help text and collapsable sections in filter form.

 * Version BETA_0_1

 First release including:

   * Navigator: an application navigation component.  This component
     sits at the top of the page and allows the user to selcect the
     "target type" (context, e.g. node), the "target value"
     (e.g. T0_CH_CERN_Export) and the widget (e.g. Links).  A global
     filter maintains filter state between widgets and provides a
     syntax for filter options to be applied to widgets.
   * Nodes widget: shows a list of nodes and associated properties in
     a sortable table.
   * Agents widget: shows a list of agents and associated properties
     in a sortable table
   * LinkView widget: shows the incoming/outgoing transfers for a
     given node, including the recent transfer statistics (rate,
     errors, quality) and the number of files currently in queue.  The
     user may drill-down into a link to see the currently queued
     blocks and files.
   * Context-Menu based navigation and operation.  Users can right-
     click on elements to navigate to another view of that element
     (e.g., see the agents running from some node clicked on) or issue
     commands to the widget (e.g. sort by that data field)

 This release is for early evaluation of the application and is
 intended to demonstrate the framework for which further widgets will
 be built upon.  The widgets provided are intended to be functional
 for their purpose, but by no means are all requirements of this
 application met in this release.
