<h1>PhEDEx deployment status as of 2004-09-13</h1>

<h2>PhEDEx V1</h2>

<p>Currently transferring with V1: INFN, PIC, FNAL.</p>

<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: Transferred all available hg03_H2mu_maX_tbY datasets;
      42 files are missing in a couple of pathological states (FIXME:
      savannah tracking ticket).</li>

 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: cancel subscription for hg03_DY2mu_shat80; don't want
      it and have not downloaded it (reason for many pending files)
      (FIXME: savannah tracking ticket).</li>

 <li> All: Stage-ins are a major headache.  Will be solved by the
      switch to V2 (FIXME: savannah tracking ticket).</li>
</ul>

<p>Agents in use:</p>
<ul>
 <li> CNAF-INFN T1:</li>
 <li> PIC:</li>
 <li> FNAL:</li>
</ul>

<h2>PhDEx V2</h2>

<p>V2 topologies: currently CastorGrid to all T1s back and forth,
each T1 should also have one-way link to a MSS node associated with
the transfer node.</p>

<p>Current status:</p>
<ul>
 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: Transfer node ready.  mu03b_DY2mu_Mll2000 test
      data (237 files) downloaded.  MSS node being worked on.  No
      export yet, but have lots of local scripts for verifying
      transfer state.  Not implemented schema changes yet.</li>

 <li> PIC: Transfer node ready.  No schema update yet.  MSS node
      being worked on.  Will try using example agents.  No export
      yet; will try example agents.</li>

 <li> FZK: Not transferring yet, but expect to test in a couple of
      days.  Will use example agent for transfers to disk, but have
      only limited disk space available.  Working on SRM migration
      separately, but have issues.  No export.</li>

 <li> ASCC: Testing example transfer agents with various degress of
      success (bugs in example agents).  No MSS node yet.  No export.<li>

 <li> FNAL: No report yet.</li>

 <li> IN2P3: No report yet.</li>

 <li> RAL: No report yet.</li>
