<h1>PhEDEx deployment status as of 2004-09-13</h1>

<h2>PhEDEx V1</h2>

<p>Currently transferring with V1: INFN, PIC, FNAL.</p>

<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: Transferred all available hg03_H2mu_maX_tbY datasets;
      42 files are missing in a couple of pathological states (FIXME:
      savannah tracking ticket).</li>

 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: cancel subscription for hg03_DY2mu_shat80; don't want
      it and have not downloaded it (reason for many pending files)
      (FIXME: savannah tracking ticket).</li>

 <li> RAL: Promised disks (30 TB) still not available; current best
      estimate is October.</li>

 <li> PIC: No issues, but haven't transferred anything recently.</li>

 <li> All: Stage-ins are a major headache.  Will be solved by the
      switch to V2 (FIXME: savannah tracking ticket).</li>
</ul>

<p>Agents in use:</p>
<ul>
 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: INFN C agent.</li>
 <li> PIC: PIC C agent.</li>
 <li> FNAL:</li>
</ul>

<h2>PhDEx V2</h2>

<p>V2 topologies: currently CastorGrid to all T1s back and forth,
each T1 should also have one-way link to a MSS node associated with
the transfer node.  PIC-CIEMAT two-way link from PIC Tier-1 transfer
node to CIEMAT Tier-2.</p>

<p>Technology:</p>
<ul>
 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: LCG-2 SE.  Castor MSS.  INFN C agent.</li>
 <li> PIC T1: LCG-2 SE?  Castor MSS.  PIC C agent.</li>
 <li> CIEMAT T2: LCG-2 SE?  No MSS.  Agent?</li>
 <li> FZK: Disk buffer, dCache MSS via SRM.  Toolkit.</li>
 <li> ASCC: LCG-2 SE.  Castor MSS.  Toolkit.</li>
 <li> RAL: ADS.  Toolkit.</li>
 <li> IN2P3: </li>
 <li> FNAL: </li>
</ul>

<p>Current status:</p>
<ul>
 <li> CNAF-INFN T1: Transfer node ready; no schema changes yet.
      mu03b_DY2mu_Mll2000 test data (237 files) downloaded.  MSS
      node being worked on.  No export yet, but have lots of local
      scripts for verifying transfer state; expect to test export
      during/after workshop.</li>

 <li> PIC T1: Transfer node ready, sample data downloaded.  No
      schema update yet.  MSS node being worked on.  Will try
      using example agents.  No export yet; will try example
      agents during/after workshop.</li>

 <li> CIEMAT T2: Transfer node ready but topology not tested, test
      data not downloaded yet.  No schema update yet.  No MSS, so
      no agent needed.  No export yet.</li>

 <li> FZK T1: Not transferring yet, but expect to test in a couple of
      days.  Will use example agent for transfers to disk, but have
      only limited disk space available.  Working on SRM migration
      separately, but have issues with that.  No export yet, expect
      to try during/after workshop, depends on SRM (2-3 weeks?).</li>

 <li> ASCC T1/NCU T2: Testing example transfer agents with various
      degress of success (bugs in example agents).  No MSS node yet.
      No export yet.<li>

 <li> RAL: No transfers, disk still unavailable.  Will use toolkit
      where possible.  Estimate one working week (latency uncertain)
      to implement when hardware comes.  Export expected mid/late
      Q4/2004.</li>

 <li> FNAL: No report yet.</li>

 <li> IN2P3: No report yet.</li>
