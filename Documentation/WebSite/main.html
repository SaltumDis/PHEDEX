<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Welcome to the PhEDEx Project homepage.  PhEDEx is the data transfer system
used to move CMS physics data; the acronym stands for "Physics Experiment Data
Export."  The system consists of the following components:</p>

<ol>
 <li> Transfer management database (TMDB), currently version is 2.</li>
 <li> Transfer agents that manage the movement of files between sites.
 This also includes agents to migrate files to mass storage, to
 manage local mass storage stager pools and stage in files efficiently
 based on transfer demand, and to calculate file checksums when necessary
 before transfers.</li>
 <li> Management agents, in particular the allocator agent which assigns
 files to destinations based on site data subscriptions, and agents to
 maintains file transfer topology routing information.</li>
 <li> Tools to manage transfer requests; CMS/RefDB/PubDB specific.</li>
 <li> Local agents for managing files locally, for
 instance as files arrive from a transfer request or a production farm,
 including any processing that needs to be done before they can be made
 available for transfer: massaging information, merging files, registering
 files into the catalogues, injecting into TMDB.</li>
 <li> Web monitoring tools.</li>
</ol>
