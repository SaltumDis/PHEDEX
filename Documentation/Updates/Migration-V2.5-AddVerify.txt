# This file describes the procedure for adding the Block Verification 
# schema and tools to a PhEDEx 2.5.x installation. This is the procedure
# used to deploy in the Dev instance. I assume you are in the root of the
# PHEDEX installation, and that you are running on vocms20.

# Setup environment
export DBPARAM=....
export PHEDEX_DB=$DBPARAM:Dev/Admin
export SQLPLUS_CONNECT=$(PHEDEX/Utilities/OracleConnectId -db $PHEDEX_DB)
export TNS_ADMIN=/afs/cern.ch/project/oracle/admin

# If your PERL5LIB hasn't already been set up, do it now:
export PERL5LIB=`pwd`/perl_lib

# Update the schema with sqlplus
#
# N.B. This doesn't work out of the box, there are FK constraints that
# cannot be created properly :-( Specifically, neither fk_dvs_block_block 
# nor fk_status_block_verify_block can be created enabled. This is hacked
# around in the sql, the constraints are created disabled. This needs to 
# be fixed before releasing in Production, I guess.
