* Changes in PhEDEx 2.3.3

 General changes:
  - Download agent improvements:
    - The agent now uses from_node to determine to_pfn so the trivial
      file catalogue can offer different destination PFNs based on
      the source site using "destination-match".  This now reflects
      export side better: both download source and destination use a
      compatible convention.
    - Error logging has changed.  The log file for a failed transfer
      is now mentioned in the file transfer failure alert, not in a
      separate message.  The -validate etc. utility commands log the
      output directly to the main agent log, not separate log files.
      The agent now removes logs older than three days when the agent
      is idle (was 15 minutes of idle time).  The log for the transfer
      command now includes the full command line and the exit code.
      The log file prefixing scheme should no longer lose newlines.
    - Subprocess queue is no longer overfilled.  This should reduce
      the number of instances of time_transfer > timeout setting; the
      still runs only for the timeout period, the rest is queue wait.
    - Stopping the agent now correctly runs transfer validation.

  - File routing improvements:
    - The agent now routes only for nodes which have recently ran a
      download agent.  This prevents creation of routes for sites
      which are down, and therefore excessive transfer expiration.
    - File routing requests are now removed if the underlying dataset
      subscription has been suspended or removed.
    - Idle transfer requests with no file request are now removed.
      This prevents unnecessary transfers when routing changes, and
      automatically removes transfers when subscription is suspended.
    - If a file has already reached the destination, then removed,
      routes are now recreated automatically.  (See schema changes.)
    - Prevent race conditions with new file injection and routing.

  - Minor improvements to the status web browser.
    - Faster loading transfer rate page.
    - Transfer rate sorts by more values for better ordering.
    - Plot of pending transfer queue is now correct.

 Schema changes:
  - Additional trigger to reinsert transfer requests for removed replicas.
  - Corrected time in trigger to insert transfer requests for new files.
  - File routing tables enforce access only at CERN.

* Changes in PhEDEx 2.3.2

 General changes:
  - Update of "ftscp".
  - Download agent errors with -ignore/-accept options fixed.
  - Master now supports "kill" option, and can "renice" agents.
  - Database deadlocks with download/export agents should now be solved.
  - Improvements and minor fixes in the file routing algorithms.
  - Many performance optimisations and streamlining in various agents.
    Anything involving node filters (-nodes, -ignore, -accept) was
    reimplemented to be more database performance friendly.
  - Minor updates to the web pages and plots.
  - Some new tests have been included.

 Schema changes:
  - Database index review.  Many indexes have been added and removed.
  - t_dps_block_dest has a new 'state' column.
  - New trigger tr_xfer_file_insert, which inserts files for active
    block destinations automatically into t_xfer_request.
  - t_info_* tables now have constraints.
