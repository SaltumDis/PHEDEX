0.94 (2005-01-27)
- fixed problem in dns bridge that prevented www.kenosisp2p.org from
  resolving.
- nodes use more than one thread to handle requests.
- btmakemetafile will not make files with bad node addresses.
- nodes save their state automatically if given a config file
- kenosis.tac.py saves its routing table and node address across
  restarts
- fixed bug when a node's routing table led it to expect that an ip
  address referred to a node with a different node address than was
  actually there.
- persist bootstrap addresses

0.93 (2005-01-13)
- added services. Now nodes can route requests among nodes that
  support their named request handlers.

0.92 (2005-01-06)
- fixed cpu usage during a find nodes operation. We were not clearing
  an Event object.
- imported public API into kenosis directly -- no need to import
  address or node now
- improved the doc strings on some pieces of code.
- nodes automatically bootstrap by default
- string addresses are now the only public node addresses exported by
  kenosis.
- Node now takes a list of ports to try to bind to rather than a
  single port.


0.91 (2004-12-21)
- Node automatically starts threaded serving behavior, constructor
  allows disabling this
