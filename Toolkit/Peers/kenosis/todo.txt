- BitTorrent/Kenosis quick start 
- change required python version to 2.3
- create INSTALL, README, COPYING files
- officially adopt MIT licens
- write more documentation, ask for help

- make nodes respect a limit to the number of threads that they use to
  handle requests.
- write propper unit test for bootstrap persistance
- maybe allow apps to set their own timeouts (or at least use a higher
  timeout once the connection has been established).
- chanage license to lgpl to accomodate upnp code.
- when a "timed out" request finally completes, we should update the
  routing table 

done:
- more sophisticated timeout handling. if there are bogus entries in
  the routing table, they currently add a lot of latency to node address
  lookups
- change node.py to set the timeout for its sockets rather than using
  setdefaulttimeout
- increased time between identical calls to the same remote node
- created a thread pool for kenosisdns' front-end threads
- changed kenosis.tac to not use python threads. This makes it not
  deadlock on linux (versus macosx).
- changed ip addresses for servers.
- added support for upnp
- added support for Zeroconf/Rendezvous
- make kenosis.tac actually remember routing table between runs

before doing releases:
- check node.defaultBootstrapNetAddress, timeouts, etc
- check node.version and node.protocolVersion
- update release notes
- check kenosis/index.html's example code for correctness
- commit changes
- update root servers
