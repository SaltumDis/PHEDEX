This is a first attempt at exploring what we need from a test harness. In this
directory are contained a number of tests (e.g. SimpleTwoNode) that will test
the behaviour of elements of the PhEDEx routing system.

At present (first iteration) there a number of files in each test directory:

prep.sql
clean.sql
idealtable.txt
run

The first two are used to prep and clean the TMDB before and after the test. The
third contains the output we expect from a query on the TMDB that is run during
the test. The fourth is a test executable. This preps the TMDB, start agents, runs
the test, stops the agents and cleans the TMDB again.

In addition, there needs to be an env.sh script in the Routing directory; an
example from RAL is included here.
The agents and run also need to access a DBparam file to connect to the TMDB.

Future:

run can be made pretty generic- the only test-specific part at the moment is the
stuff in testLoop. This should be extracted into a specific test executable for 
each test, and run moved to the top level dir (or into Testbed proper?).
