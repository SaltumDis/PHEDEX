Disk pool dump (pfn, size)is produced daily and published on the web in the foolowing format:

The 'datastaged' date is generally newer than the files' ctime.

Contents of the tape storage can be accessed with nsls, nsfind commands, which gives all desired attributes: pfn, size, adler32, ctime.
Full nsls/nsfind-based dump was not attempted by the site due to:
* scalability issues
* several CERN sites share the same namespace

Further tests should first be negotiated with Castor operations team (CMS liason: Stephen Gowdy).
Meanwhile we can check for dark data and monitore space usage on the disk pools.
